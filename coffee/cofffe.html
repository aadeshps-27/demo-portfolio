        <p class="startaa">Coffee lovers around the world who reach for their favorite morning brew probably aren’t thinking about its health benefits or risks. And yet this beverage has been subject to a long history of debate. In 1991 coffee was included in a list of possible carcinogens by the World Health Organization. By 2016 it was exonerated, as research found that the beverage was not associated with an increased risk of cancer; on the contrary, there was a decreased risk of certain cancers among those who drink coffee regularly once smoking history was properly accounted for. Additional accumulating research suggests that when consumed in moderation, coffee can be considered a healthy beverage. Why then in 2018 did one U.S. state pass legislation that coffee must bear a cancer warning label? Read on to explore the complexities of coffee.</p>

        <h1 class="typ">Types of Coffee Beans</h1>
        <p class="startcc">In U.S. supermarkets, you’ll typically find two types of coffee beans for sale: Arabica and Robusta. You may be wondering, is there a difference between Arabica and Robusta? Oh, there definitely is. Let’s get right to it.</p>
<li><i class="itc">Arabica:-</i><p  class="startcc">Arabica is the most popular type of coffee, hands down. Depending on who you ask, many coffee enthusiasts prefer using Arabica beans due to its taste. Typically used for black coffee, Arabica beans have a sweeter, more complex flavor that you can drink straight. Funny thing is, even though it’s the most popular, it doesn’t have as much caffeine as Robusta.</p></li>
<li><i class="itc">Robusta:-</i><p  class="startcc">While Arabica is the most popular, Robusta is cheaper and stronger. Because of its bitter flavor, you’ll typically see Robusta used for espresso drinks and in instant coffee mixes. If your Monday morning is lagging, reach for a cup of coffee that uses Robusta beans. Their high caffeine content will wake you right up! </p></li>

<h1 class="typ">Types of Coffee Drinks</h1>

<p class="startcc">Latte, americano, affogato…it’s crazy all that you can do with a few small beans. Whether you’re a coffee newbie or you consider yourself a coffee connoisseur, there are so many types of coffee drinks to discover. Here are some of the most popular types ordered by coffee lovers nationwide</p>

<li><i class="itc"><i class="itc">Black:-</i><p  class="startcc">Black coffee is as simple as it gets with ground coffee beans steeped in hot water, served warm. And if you want to sound fancy, you can call black coffee by its proper name: cafe noir. Since it isn’t doctored up with milk or sugar, the quality of coffee is especially important. Treat yourself to a coffee subscription box to find your favorite style.</p></li>
<li><i class="itc"><i class="itc">Cappuccino:-</i><p  class="startcc">Cappuccino is a latte made with more foam than steamed milk, often with a sprinkle of cocoa powder or cinnamon on top. Sometimes you can find variations that use cream instead of milk or ones that throw in flavor shot, as well.</p>
</li>
<li><i class="itc"><i class="itc">Americano:-</i><p  class="startcc">With a similar flavor to black coffee, the americano consists of an espresso shot diluted in hot water. Pro tip: if you’re making your own, pour the espresso first, then add the hot water.</p>
</li>
<li><i class="itc"><i class="itc">Espresso:-</i><p  class="startcc">An espresso shot can be served solo or used as the foundation of most coffee drinks, like lattes and macchiatos. If you’re an at-home barista, these espresso accessories will come in handy.</p>

    <p class="star">Dunkin' Donuts LLC,[1] also known as Dunkin'[n 1] and by the initials DD, is an American multinational coffee and doughnut company, as well as a quick service restaurant. It was founded by Bill Rosenberg (1916–2002) in Quincy, Massachusetts, in 1950. The chain was acquired by Baskin-Robbins's holding company Allied Lyons in 1990; its acquisition of the Mister Donut chain and the conversion of that chain to Dunkin' Donuts facilitated the brand's growth in North America that year.[5] Dunkin' and Baskin-Robbins eventually became subsidiaries of Dunkin' Brands, headquartered in Canton, Massachusetts, in 2004, until being purchased by Inspire Brands on December 15, 2020. The chain began rebranding as a "beverage-led company", and was renamed Dunkin', in January 2019; while stores in the U.S. began using the new name, the rebranding will eventually be rolled out to all of its international store</p>

        <p class="star">McCafé is a coffee-house-style food and beverage chain, owned by McDonald's. Conceptualised and launched in Melbourne, Australia, in 1993,[1] and introduced to the public with help from McDonald's CEO Charlie Bell and then-chairman and future CEO James Skinner, the chain reflects a consumer trend towards espresso coffees.[2]

            Reports indicated that McCafé outlets generated 15% more revenue than a regular McDonald's and, by 2003, were the largest coffee shop brand in Australia and New Zealand.[3] After McDonald's Australia experimented with automatic espresso-pronto machines in the last decade and it failed to catch on, all Australian stores were subsequently renovated and converted to McCafé outlets.</p>
